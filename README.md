# Inverse_kinematics_using_LGP

Built during course at Chalmers. 

To run the programs, Python and all the used libraries are required. There are
4 python files ”LPG.py”, ”fitnessFunction.py”, ”forwKinematicsModel.py” and
”plotResult.py”.

To run the training, run the file ”LPG.py”. All settings are determined in the function called main(). 

There are 4 matlab files for the test program. ”analyze result.m”, ”DecodeChromosome.m”, ”forwKinematicsModel.m” and ”getPositions.m”. They are all
translated from python code since it was required in the home problem. To run the test script in Matlab, use ”analyze result.m”. Set the test nr, folder and number of datapoints you want to test with for the chromosome.

There is a report for home problem 2.1 and 2.2 in the hand-in files, where the algorithm and calculations are described.
